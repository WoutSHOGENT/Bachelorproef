  abstract = {Hospital Institutions face many challenges. Because of this, improved management allows for better healthcare and the efficient functioning of the institution. IT comes along the field of hospital logistics to automate processes, reduce costs and time, and globally improve the functioning of the hospital. Given the evolutionary needs of Health Institutions, the advantages of having a system for hospital logistics, available to use in the latest devices, on Web and Mobile environments, were perceived. This innovation will enable Health Institutions to achieve greater mobility between services, greater efficiency, among others. To explore this need, there was developed an application that allows the management of requests for material required for hospital services in order to affect positively the management of these hospital institutions. This development was made in an entrepreneurial environment, in order to satisfy the needs of the users of the company's implemented solutions, to contribute to their technological evolution. The developed application has three modules: "Serviços", "Armazém Interno"e "Bens de Consumo". At the beginning of the development, it was performed an investigation to identify the value of hospital logistics and the influential role of IT in this area. Then, it was performed the study of technologies to choose the most suitable ones. Next, the functional and non-functional requirements that the application should satisfy were analyzed.},

  abstract       = {The increasing complexity of mechanical manufacturing demands intelligent, integrated solutions to maintain high levels of precision, efficiency, and traceability. While ERP systems provide centralized management for core business functions, they often fall short in addressing operational-level workflows on the shopfloor. This paper presents the development and implementation of GIP (Gestão Integrada de Produção—Integrated Production Management), a custom software solution designed to bridge this gap for a small-to-medium enterprise (SME) specializing in precision mechanical components. GIP automates manual tasks such as technical drawing validation, file management, and part tracking, significantly reducing approval times and human error while enhancing traceability through unique DataMatrix part marking and centralized data logging. Developed with a modular, user-centered design using C# and SQL Server, the system integrates seamlessly with existing ERP infrastructure, following Industry 4.0 principles. Its deployment resulted in quantifiable improvements in productivity, data security, interdepartmental communication, and project delivery times. The success of GIP underscores the benefits of complementing ERP platforms with task-specific tools tailored to real user workflows. This approach aligns with smart manufacturing trends such as digital threads and digital twins, laying the groundwork for future enhancements in predictive maintenance and real-time analytics. GIP demonstrates how agile, scalable digital tools can drive competitiveness in modern industrial environments.},
